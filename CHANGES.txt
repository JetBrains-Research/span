Version 1.1
----------------

Released on Mar 9th, 2023

- Bugfix update - fix problem with treatment and control scaling
- Upscale treatment and control library
- Slightly tweaked defaults - number of iterations and threshold till convergence
- Reverted compatibility with Java 8

Version 1.0
----------------

Released on Oct 12th, 2022

- Switched to new procedure for computing peaks from HMM:
 * 1) Estimate HMM posterior error probabilities
 * 2) Pick candidate bins with relaxed posterior error probability, e.g. sqrt(fdr).
 * This mitigates the problem of wide marks peaks split on strong fdrs.
 * 3) Using gap merge bins into candidate islands.
 * 4) Assign p-value to each island using based on combined p-values for blocks of consequent enriched bins.
 *    Each block is assigned P as average posterior log error probability for bins in blocks.
 *    50% top significant blocks scores are aggregated using length-weighted average as P for island.
 * 5) Compute qvalues on islands p-values, filter by alpha.
- Improved treatment and control normalization, use beta minimizing absolute correlation between
  corrected signal and control: |correlation(scaled-treatment - beta * scaled-control, scaled-control)|
- Improved multistart initial NB states guess - use different params for each model
- Safeguard against infinite failures as initial guess for NB, which effectively converts NB to Poisson
- Show progress while computing peaks from model
- Updated defaults values for SPAN peaks: fdr 0.05, gap 3
- Updated defaults for SPAN model: total iterations 20, log-likelihood threshold 1
- Reduced time required for peak calling
- Added advanced SPAN model viewer in JBR genome browser
- Bugfixes


Version 0.13
----------------

Released on Aug 12th, 2020

- Bugfixes in log formats


Version 0.12.0
----------------

Released on Apr 21th, 2020

- Fixed multistart procedure
- Switched to SL4J and Backlog logging

Version 0.11.0
-------------

Released on May 17th, 2019

- If the model file is present, Span can now call and tune peaks with no further options required
- If the options are nevertheless provided, they're checked against those stored in the model file
- Span recognizes explicit options `--fragment auto` and `--keep-dup false` (previously, the user had to
omit the options to achieve this result)
- Reduced statistical data model convergence time
- Changed model initial point
- Multistart for model fitting
- Safeguards against NB parameters vanishing for small signal-to-noise ratio or insufficient number of reads

Version 0.10.0
-------------

Released on March 22, 2019

- ATAC-Seq support -  `--fragment 0` option works correctly in paired end reads case
- Single Cell ATAC-Seq supported - `--keep-dup` options allows duplicated alignments in same position
- SPAN model name can be configured explicitly by `--model`, default name is more user-friendly
- SPAN doesn't ignore contigs (alternative, random) chromosomes in peak calling anymore
