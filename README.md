**SPAN Peak Analyzer** is a semi-supervised multipurpose peak caller capable of processing a broad range of ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and single-cell ATAC-seq datasets that robustly handles multiple replicates and noise by leveraging limited manual annotation information.\
Part of integrated [peak calling](https://research.jetbrains.org/groups/biolabs/projects?project_id=71) solution.

About
-----

Detailed description is available on JetBrains Research Biolabs SPAN [page](https://research.jetbrains.org/groups/biolabs/tools/span-peak-analyzer).

### Requirements

1. Download and install [Java 8][java8].
2. Download the `<build>.chrom.sizes` chromosome sizes of the organism you want to analyze from the UCSC [website][UCSC].

### Analysis

To analyze a single (possibly replicated) biological condition use `analyze` command. See details with command:

```bash
$ java -jar span.jar analyze --help
```

The `<output.bed>` file will contain predicted and FDR-controlled peaks in the ENCODE [broadPeak](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format13) (BED 6+3) format (like [MACS2](https://github.com/taoliu/MACS)):
```
<chromosome> <peak start offset> <peak end offset> <peak_name> <score> . <coverage or fold/change> <-log p-value> <-log Q-value>
```

`analyze` reports p- and [Q-values] [q] for the null-hypothesis that a
given bin is not enriched with ChIP-Seq modification. Peaks are formed from a list of truly (in the FDR sense)
**enriched** bins for the analyzed biological condition by thresholding
the Q-value with a threshold `alpha` and merging close peaks using `gap` option to broad ones.
This is equivalent to controlling FDR at level `alpha`.
If control is given it will be used with `fragment_size` to compute coverage for analysis.

### Comparison

The compare two (possibly replicated) biological conditions use the `compare`. See help for details:

```bash
$ java -jar span.jar compare --help
```

The structure of output produced by `compare` is similar to that of `analyze`.
The null-hypotheses however are different. By default `compare` assumes that
there is no difference in **enrichment** for the two biological conditions.
